Java LSP settings

Currently I use jdtls base on [nvim-lspinstall](https://github.com/kabouzeid/nvim-lspinstall),
The `jdtls.sh` file in lspinstall have some issues when I use,
So I edit it and backup this file in here.
To let it work, execute these commands, change `~/project/my/config` to your path of this repo:
```
ln -sf ~/project/my/config/nvim/lua/lsp/java/jdtls.sh ~/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall/java/jdtls.sh
```
