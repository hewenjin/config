# Personal config
Used to management my personal configuration, If something here is helpful, You can also use any code you like from this repo.

## directory description
### dotfiles
My home directory dotfiles. note that `.vimrc` is deprecated, I use neovim now.
To use `dotfiles/.tmux.conf.local`, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) & [oh-my-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) needs to install first. 

### nvim
My neovim configuration. since neovim 0.5 version, lot plugins are not compatible with vim, so I completely separated vim and neovim configuration. 

### IM
Input method config

### DE
Desktop environment config backup

### alacritty
[alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) config
